This project demonstrates a linear regression model to predict home prices based on features such as area, number of bedrooms, and home age. The dataset used contains information about different houses, and the model predicts prices based on the input features.

The model uses the following steps:
Data is split into training and testing sets using train_test_split.
A linear regression model is trained using LinearRegression from scikit-learn.
